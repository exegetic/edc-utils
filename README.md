misc-scripts
============

Grab bag of random scripts I've found useful. Currently contains:

* **lsd**: Performs 'ls', but exclusively on directories. 
  Takes all the usual ls flags.
* **chrome-alt**: Super lazy way to launch parallel Chrome
  instances with different user profiles. A default profile 
  can be set via an environment variable, and it includes 
  some not-terrible user-data-dir defaults for both OS X &
  Linux.

Also, a few assorted gists: https://gist.github.com/nwinant
